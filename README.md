# plots-googlegroups

The Public Lab for Open Science and Technology (Public Lab) is an organization and community that responds to environmental concerns through the development of low cost DIY tools, supported by an international network of organizers, technologists, scientists, and activists.  Collaboration is facilitated through a suite of online tools two among which are an interactive wiki, and 26 GoogleGroups.  The following project represents an effort to charactorize the forum dynamics of the 26 GoogleGroups.  

The process is caputured in the following notebooks:

1. Collection: [collection.ipynb.ipynb](https://github.com/skilfullycurled/plots-googlegroups/blob/master/collection.ipynb)
2. Processing: [data_processing.ipynb](https://github.com/skilfullycurled/plots-googlegroups/blob/master/data_processing.ipynb)
3. Aggregation of forum statistics: [exploratory_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/skilfullycurled/plots-googlegroups/blob/master/exploratory_analysis.ipynb)
4. Agreegation of network statistics: [graph_construction.ipynb](https://github.com/skilfullycurled/plots-googlegroups/blob/master/graph_construction.ipynb)
5. SVM Forum Analysis: [results.ipynb](https://github.com/skilfullycurled/plots-googlegroups/blob/master/results.ipynb)
